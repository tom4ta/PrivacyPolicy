Privacy Policy for Calm StepsEffective 
Date: November 11, 2025Calm Steps ("App," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application available on the Apple App Store (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we discover we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information promptly. For more details, see our Children's Privacy (#childrens-privacy) section below.1. Information We CollectWe minimize data collection to provide a safe, focused experience. The App may collect the following types of information:Personal Information
•	None collected by default: The App does not require user accounts, logins, or direct entry of personal details like names, emails, or addresses. It operates offline where possible for core features (e.g., emotion-behavior exercises).
Non-Personal Information
•	Usage Data: Anonymized analytics on how you interact with the App, such as session duration, feature usage (e.g., which emotion tools you access), and crash reports. This helps us improve the App.
•	Device Information: Basic details like device type (e.g., iPhone model), iOS version, and language settings to ensure compatibility and bug fixes. No unique identifiers like IMEI are collected.
•	Location Data: Not collected. All features are location-agnostic.
We use third-party services like Expo (for app building) and Apple Analytics, which may collect limited anonymized data as per their policies. See Third-Party Services (#third-party-services) for details.2. How We Use InformationWe use collected information solely to:
•	Enhance App functionality and user experience (e.g., prioritizing popular emotion exercises).
•	Debug and maintain the App (e.g., fixing crashes based on usage patterns).
•	Comply with legal obligations.
We do not use your information for marketing, advertising, or selling to third parties.3. Sharing InformationWe do not sell, rent, or share your personal information. Limited non-personal data may be shared with:
•	Service Providers: Trusted vendors (e.g., Expo for app deployment, Apple for App Store distribution) who process data on our behalf under strict confidentiality. They are prohibited from using it for other purposes.
•	Legal Requirements: If required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or to protect our rights.
No data is shared with advertisers or for cross-app tracking.4. Children's PrivacyThe App is designed for children and families, aligning with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not:
•	Collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent (which we do not seek, as no such collection occurs).
•	Condition participation on disclosing more information than necessary.
Parents: If you believe your child has provided information to us, contact us at [tom@fortier.com] to request deletion.5. Data Security. We implement reasonable security measures, including encryption for any transmitted data and secure storage practices, to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no system is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.6. Your Rights and Choices
•	Access and Deletion: Since we collect minimal data, you can reset usage analytics via iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements. For full data deletion, uninstall the App.
•	Do Not Track: We honor iOS privacy signals and do not respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals, as the App is native.
•	Updates: Check this policy periodically for changes.
Under applicable laws (e.g., GDPR for EU users or CCPA for California residents), you may have additional rights like data portability. Contact us to exercise them.7. Third-Party ServicesThe App integrates:
•	Expo/React Native: For app runtime. See Expo Privacy Policy.
•	Apple Services: For distribution and analytics. See Apple Privacy Policy.
Links to external sites (if added) have their own policies.8. Changes to This Privacy PolicyWe may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices. We'll notify you via in-App notices or the App Store listing for material changes. Continued use after updates means acceptance.9. Contact UsFor questions, concerns, or requests:
